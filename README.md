Xamarin.Forms cross-platform Mobile App (Android/iOS/UWP)

This app was written in C#/.NET with an MVVM design pattern. The purpose of this
app was to allow people to rent scooters from the two most popular scooter 
ride-share companies (Bird/Lime), all from one app. Below are two YouTube videos
and a slide presentation that demonstrate the app.

__Note: This app is entirely experimental and not for sale or production use__
