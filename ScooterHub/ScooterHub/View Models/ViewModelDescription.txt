This folder contains ALL classes that compute algorithms, perform business logic, and translate data for the GUI/View of the program.

This is where the heart of our program will be - we will call and use the Bird, Lime, Xamarin.Essentials, and etc. APIs here, plus code
any algorithms and whatever else is necessary for computations.

The ViewModel(s) transfer data to and from the Data Model(s) and View(s) via Data Binding so that our code is NOT tightly coupled.
