This folder contains ALL classes that compute algorithms, perform business logic, and translate data for the GUI/View of the program.

This is where we will call the Google API and programatically create the map, add pins, stylize the map, etc.

The ViewModel(s) transfer data to the View(s) via Data Binding so that our code is NOT tightly coupled.
